Hi, I’m Mishka! 👋

👀 I’m interested in solving real-world problems using tech — especially in education, healthcare & sustainability  
🌱 I’m currently learning React, mastering DSA (C++), and exploring AI use cases in medicine & automation  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly, impactful open-source projects and ideas that can scale
